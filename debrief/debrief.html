<h3>Thank you for completing this experiment!</h3>

<p>Thank you for participating in our project investigating how people make decisions in environments where characteristics of two options (e.g., difficulty, reward) have to be learned through experience in order to maximise reward.</p>

<p>The choices and response times collected from this research can be used to differentiate between theories of learning and decision-making. In particular, this research aims to assess whether people tend to use heuristics that utilize only part of the information available and a simple rule, or more optimal processes that utilize the full information available in such decisions. This research also aims to investigate how well people learn about the decision environment, what characteristics are salient, and how peopleâ€™s choices evolve over time. By fitting data to computational models that were developed based on these theories and comparing the model fits, we can assess which theory of decision-making is more likely and how the characteristics of the decision environment are learned over time. </p>
